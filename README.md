## Getting Started ðŸš€

These instructions will guide to test the project on your own or you local machine

### Prerequisites

If you wish to test the code online : [to be completed]

Make sure to have Python 3x installed on your computer
Run the following in your command prompt

```
python
```

I used **Python 3.8.0** to built this program, Python 3.0 to 3.8 will work.

### Installing

A step by step that tell you how to get my code up and running on your local machine :

- Clone my repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Mcflan-7/P7_prometheus.git
```

- Set up your virtual environnement (using venv for this example, any will do)

```
python -m venv venv
```

- Activate your virtual environement with

  ```
  Windows: source venv/Scripts/activate
  MacOS: source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- Install the requirement with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- CD to the app directory

```
cd prometheus
```

- Export the app and run flask

```
export FLASK_APP=index.py
python -m flask run

```

## Built With ðŸ› 

- [Python](<[https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)>) - The programming language that lets you work quicklyand integrate systems more effectively
- [Flask](<[https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/(https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)>) - Web development one drop at a time
- [VSCODE](<[https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)>) - The code editing redefined
